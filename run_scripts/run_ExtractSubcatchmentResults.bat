REM This is an example script to run ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py and
REM adap2shp.py in order to produce a shapefile of SWMM subcatchment
REM simulation results.
REM Syntax:
REM 	python ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py [INFILE.wkt] [INFILE.rpt] [OUTFILE.wkt]
REM 	python adap2shp.py [INFILE_subcatchments.asc] [INFILE.wkt] [OUTFILE.shp] 'epsg:XXXX'


REM Activate conda environment (with necessary packages installed)
REM (here called 'gistoswmm5')
call conda.bat activate gistoswmm5
